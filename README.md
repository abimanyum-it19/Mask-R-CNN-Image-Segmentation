# Task :-
Mask R-CNN is an object detection model based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)
developed by a group of Facebook AI researchers in 2017. The model can return both the bounding box
and a mask for each detected object in an image.

# Mask-R-CNN-Image-Segmentation
There is a total number of 100 beagle images in the dataset which I scraped from Google Image. 75 images are used for training and 25 images are used for validation.
I used VGG Image Annotator (VIA) to annotate the training and validation images.
